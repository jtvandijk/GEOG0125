# Unix tools and Database Management

This week we will be looking at the Unix tools and database management. Basic knowledge of the Unix shell as well as knowing how to retrieve datasets from databases are essential tools in a data scientist’s toolkit. This week you will be introduced to both. In the practical component of this week you will work within the 'bourne again shell' (bash) in a command-line environment to create a parallel data processing pipeline involving a database and Unix tools.
