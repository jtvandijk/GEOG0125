# (PART\*) Data Sciencist's Toolbox {-}

# Unix tools

## Introduction {#intro-w08}
This week we will be looking at the Unix tools. Basic knowledge of the Unix shell as well as knowing how to retrieve datasets from databases are essential tools in a data scientist’s toolkit. This week you will be introduced to both. In the practical component of this week you will work within the 'bourne again shell' (bash) in a command-line environment to create a parallel data processing pipeline involving a database and Unix tools.
