The first half of the module introduce concepts such as statistical inference, deep learning and convolutional neural network which will end with a keynote lecture from Carto on Spatial Data Science. In the second half of the module, we will introduce you to the practical skills of being a data scientists including learning about database design, unix-tools and web visualisation. We hope this module can provide you with the necessary knowledge in becoming a social and geographic data scientist in the future.

This week we will dive a little deeper into the econometrics sides of things by looking at linear models, fixed-effect models, and random-effect models. "],
["spatial-temporal-mobility-analysis.html", "2 Spatial-Temporal Mobility Analysis", " 2 Spatial-Temporal Mobility Analysis This week we will be looking at capturing mobility data with GPS, specifically we will look at how to obtain, clean, and interpret a GPS data set. We will further use Machine Learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machines and Tree-based methods, to classify labeled GPS data into ‘stay’ and ‘move’ points. This week’s content will be made available on 01/03/2021. "],

Basic knowledge of the Unix shell as well as knowing how to retrieve datasets from databases are essential tools in a data scientist’s toolkit. This week you will be introduced to both. In the practical component of this week you will work within the ‘bourne again shell’ (bash) in a command-line environment to create a parallel data processing pipeline involving a database and Unix tools. This week’s content will be made available on 08/03/2021. "],

This week we will introduce you to ‘mapping at scale’: how to display large amounts of data with interactive maps through slippy maps. In the practical component we will be using map tiles to create an interactive web map from scratch using JavaScript and Leaflet.js. This week’s content will be made available on 15/03/2021. "]
