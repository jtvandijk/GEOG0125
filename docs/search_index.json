The first half of the module introduce concepts such as statistical inference, deep learning and convolutional neural network which will end with a keynote lecture from Carto on Spatial Data Science. In the second half of the module, we will introduce you to the practical skills of being a data scientists including learning about database design, unix-tools and web visualisation. We hope this module can provide you with the necessary knowledge in becoming a social and geographic data scientist in the future.

In other words: statistical inference is the procedure through which we try to make inferences about a population based on characteristics of this population that have been captured in a sample. This includes uncovering the association between variables as well as establishing causal relationships. However, correlation does not imply causation and identifying causal relationships from observational data is not trivial. “Correlation does not imply causation” (Any statistician). This week we will dive a little deeper into statistical inference and how to establish causal relationships by taking a small dive into the field of study of econometrics. This week is structured by 4 short lecture videos, reading material, a tutorial in R with a ‘hands-on’ application of the techniques covered in the lecture videos, and a seminar on Tuesday. The short lecture videos this week are provided by an absolute expert in the field of econometrics: Dr Idahosa from the University of Johannesburg. Let’s get to it!

Although there is considerable overlap sometimes even involving the same methods, the major difference between machine learning and statistics is their purpose. Machine learning models are designed to make accurate predictions. Statistical models are designed for inference about the relationships between variables. “Statistics draws population inferences from a sample, and machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns” (Bzdok et al. 2018). Before we move onto the more complicated material, let’s have a quick refresher on linear regression models. Linear regression models offer a very interpretable way to model the association between variables. A linear regression model is used to find the line that minimises the mean squared error accross all data to establish the relationship between a response variable one or more explanatory (independent) variables. The case of one explanatory variable is called a simple linear regression; if more explanatory variables are used it is called multiple regression. Video: Linear regression models [Lecture slides] [Watch on MS stream] 1.3 Causality 1.3.1 What is causality? It should now be clear that regression is a statistical technique with the purpose to predict a target variable \\(y\\) according to some other variable \\(x\\) or variables \\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\), etc. Regression, however, cares about correlation: what happens to \\(Y\\) when \\(X=x\\). However, correlation does not imply causation. A great example is the relationships between chocolate consumption and the probability of winning a Nobel price: The higher a country’s chocolate consumption, the more Nobel laureates it spawns per capita. There is a clear correlation, but there should not exist an actual causal relationship between these two variables (Well, some research suggest it still remains unclear whether the correlation is spurious or an indication for hidden variables …) The golden standard to establish a causal relationship is to set-up and execute a randomised control trial, think of the many large-scale randomised control trials that are currently taking place to test the safety and effectiveness of various candidate coronavirus vaccines. However, it is not always possible to set up a randomised control trial. Sometimes this has to do with the nature of the relationship being investigated (e.g. establishing the effects of policy changes), but there could also be financial and ethical constraints. As an alternative, one could try to identify causal relationship from observational data. This is known as causal inference and most research in econometrics is concerned with retrieving valid estimates using different regression methods. The distinction between causal and non-causal relationships is crucial and heavily depends on your research questions. If you are trying to classify Google Street view images and predict whether the photo contains an office building or a residential building, you want to create a model that predicts this as good as possible. However, you do not care of what was the cause of the building in the photo to be an office building or a residential building. That being said: almost any question is causal and where statistics is used in almost any field of inquiry, few pay proper attention to understanding causality. By now you may wonder, sure, but what then is causality? We can say that \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\) if we were to change the value of \\(X\\) without changing anything else then as a result \\(Y\\) would also change. A simple example: if you switch on the light switch, your light will go on. The action of flipping the light switch cause your light to go on. This being said: it does not mean that \\(X\\) is necessarily the only thing that causes \\(Y\\) (e.g. the light bulb is burnt out or the light was already one) and perhaps a better way of phrasing it is to say that there is a causal relationship between variables if \\(X\\) changes the probabiblity of \\(Y\\). 1.3.2 The problem with causality The problem with establishing a causal relationship is that in many cases you cannot ‘switch on’ or ‘switch off’ a characteristic. Let’s go through this by thinking whether some \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\). Our \\(X\\) is coded as 0 or 1, for instance, 0 if a person has not received a coronavirus vaccination and 1 if a person has received a coronavirus vaccination. \\(Y\\) is some numeric value. So how do we check if \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\): for everyone in our sample we can check what will happen to \\(Y\\) when we make \\(X=0\\) and when we make \\(X=1\\). But this is obviously a problem! You cannot both have \\(X=0\\) and \\(X=1\\). You got the coronavirus vaccin or you did not and this means that if \\(X=1\\) you can measure what the value of \\(Y\\) is, but you do not know what the value of \\(Y\\) would have been if \\(X=0\\). The first thing that would come up is to compare this \\(Y\\) between individuals who have \\(X=0\\) and \\(X=1\\). However, there is another problem: there could be all kinds of reasons on why \\(Y\\) differs between individuals that are not necessarily related to \\(X\\). The main goal of causal inference is to make the best possible estimation of what \\(Y\\) would have been if \\(X\\) would have been different, One way of doing this is by fixed-effect models and random effect-models. 1.3.3 Fixed-effect models Video: Fixed-effect models [Lecture slides] [Watch on MS stream] 1.3.4 Random-effect models Video: Random-effect models [Lecture slides] [Watch on MS stream] 1.4 Take home message 1.5 Attributions This week’s content and practical uses content and inspiration from: Torres-Reyna, Oscar. 2010.
