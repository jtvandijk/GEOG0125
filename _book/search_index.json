The first half of the module introduce concepts such as statistical inference, deep learning and convolutional neural network which will end with a keynote lecture from Carto on Spatial Data Science. In the second half of the module, we will introduce you to the practical skills of being a data scientists including learning about database design, unix-tools and web visualisation. We hope this module can provide you with the necessary knowledge in becoming a social and geographic data scientist in the future.
