In other words: statistical inference is the procedure through which we try to make inferences about a population based on characteristics of this population that have been captured in a sample. Statistical inference can thus be contrasted with exploratory and descriptive data analysis, which focuses solely on the description of the data set on which the analysis is applied. This week we will dive a little deeper into the statistical inference, and in particular take a sneak peek at the field of study of econometrics. This week is structured by 4 short videos, reading material, practical material that you need to work through, and a seminar on Tuesday. Let’s get started.

He will be there for the whole hour to answer any question you have live in the meeting or any questions you have formulated beforehand. If you cannot make the meeting, feel free to post the issue you ar having in the Technical Help channel on the GEOG0125 Team so that Alfie will can help to find a solution. 1.2 Statistical inference During this course we will be talking a lot about different machine learning methods and techniques. Before we continue, however, it is good to have one week in which we focus on statistical inference. The major difference between machine learning and statistics is their purpose. Machine learning models are designed to make accurate predictions. Statistical models are designed for inference about the relationships between variables. “Statistics draws population inferences from a sample, and machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns” (Bzdok et al. 2018). Of course, this is a little bit of a blunt way to summarise the differences. Think of a linear regression model: using a train data set it can be used to make predictions about a test data set but when implemented as a statistical model it is used to find the line that minimises the mean squared error accross all data and can be used to characterise the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. Still, it does show the difference in emphasis and as such this week we will be looking at using statistical models to look into the relationships between variables with some help from the field of econometrics, who have made this into an art!
