In other words: statistical inference is the procedure through which we try to make inferences about a population based on characteristics of this population that have been captured in a sample. This includes uncovering the association between variables as well as establishing causal relationships. However, correlation does not imply causation and identifying causal relationships from observational data is not trivial. “Correlation does not imply causation” (Any statistician). This week we will dive a little deeper into statistical inference and how to establish causal relationships by taking a small dive into the field of study of econometrics. This week is structured by 4 short lecture videos, reading material, a tutorial in R with a ‘hands-on’ application of the techniques covered in the lecture videos, and a seminar on Tuesday. The short lecture videos this week are provided by an absolute expert in the field of econometrics: Dr Idahosa from the University of Johannesburg. Let’s get to it!

Although there is considerable overlap sometimes even involving the same methods, the major difference between machine learning and statistics is their purpose. Machine learning models are designed to make accurate predictions. Statistical models are designed for inference about the relationships between variables. “Statistics draws population inferences from a sample, and machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns” (Bzdok et al. 2018). Before we move onto the more complicated material, let’s have a quick refresher on linear regression models. Linear regression models offer a very interpretable way to model the association between variables. A linear regression model is used to find the line that minimises the mean squared error accross all data to establish the relationship between a response variable one or more explanatory (independent) variables. The case of one explanatory variable is called a simple linear regression; if more explanatory variables are used it is called multiple regression. Video: Linear regression models [Lecture slides] [Watch on MS stream] 1.3 Causality 1.3.1 What is causality? It should now be clear that regression is a statistical technique with the purpose to predict a target variable \\(y\\) according to some other variable \\(x\\) or variables \\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\), etc. Regression, however, cares about correlation: what happens to \\(Y\\) when \\(X=x\\). However, correlation does not imply causation. A great example is the relationships between chocolate consumption and the probability of winning a Nobel price: The higher a country’s chocolate consumption, the more Nobel laureates it spawns per capita. There is a clear correlation, but there should not exist an actual causal relationship between these two variables (Well, some research suggest it still remains unclear whether the correlation is spurious or an indication for hidden variables …) The golden standard to establish a causal relationship is to set-up and execute a randomised control trial, think of the many large-scale randomised control trials that are currently taking place to test the safety and effectiveness of various candidate coronavirus vaccines. However, it is not always possible to set up a randomised control trial. Sometimes this has to do with the nature of the relationship being investigated (e.g. establishing the effects of policy changes), but there could also be financial and ethical constraints. As an alternative, one could try to identify causal relationship from observational data. This is known as causal inference and most research in econometrics is concerned with retrieving valid estimates using different regression methods. The distinction between causal and non-causal relationships is crucial and heavily depends on your research questions. If you are trying to classify Google Street view images and predict whether the photo contains an office building or a residential building, you want to create a model that predicts this as good as possible. However, you do not care of what was the cause of the building in the photo to be an office building or a residential building. That being said: almost any question is causal and where statistics is used in almost any field of inquiry, few pay proper attention to understanding causality. By now you may wonder, sure, but what then is causality? We can say that \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\) if we were to change the value of \\(X\\) without changing anything else then as a result \\(Y\\) would also change. A simple example: if you switch on the light switch, your light will go on. The action of flipping the light switch causes your light to go on. This being said: it does not mean that \\(X\\) is necessarily the only thing that causes \\(Y\\) (e.g. the light bulb is burnt out or the light was already on) and perhaps a better way of phrasing it is to say that there is a causal relationship between variables if \\(X\\) changes the probabiblity of \\(Y\\) happening or changing. 1.3.2 The problem with causality The problem with establishing a causal relationship is that in many cases you cannot ‘switch on’ or ‘switch off’ a characteristic. Let’s go through this by thinking whether some \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\). Our \\(X\\) is coded as 0 or 1, for instance, 0 if a person has not received a coronavirus vaccination and 1 if a person has received a coronavirus vaccination. \\(Y\\) is some numeric value. So how do we check if \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\)? What we would need to do for everyone in our sample is to check what will happen to \\(Y\\) when we make \\(X=0\\) and when we make \\(X=1\\). But this is obviously a problem! You cannot both have \\(X=0\\) and \\(X=1\\): you either got inoculated against the coronavirus or you did not. This means that if \\(X=1\\) you can measure what the value of \\(Y\\) is, but you do not know what the value of \\(Y\\) would have been if \\(X=0\\). A solution you may come up with is to compare \\(Y\\) between individuals who have \\(X=0\\) and \\(X=1\\). However, there is another problem: there could be all kinds of reasons on why \\(Y\\) differs between individuals that are not necessarily related to \\(X\\). This section heavily borrows material and explanations from Nick Huntington-Klein’s excellent ECON 305: Economics, Causality, and Analytics module, do have a look if you want to learn more about this topic. This brings us to econometrics and causal inference: the main goal of causal inference is to make the best possible estimation of what \\(Y\\) would have been if \\(X\\) would have been different, the so-called counterfactual. As we cannot always use an experiment in which we can randomly assign \\(X\\) so that we know that on average people with \\(X=1\\) and the same as people with \\(X=2\\), we have to come up with a model to figure out what the counterfactual would do. In the following, we will explore two ways of doing this through so-called fixed-effect models and random effect-models in the situation in which we have multiple data points for each observation (i.e. longitudinal data or panel data). 1.3.3 Fixed-effect models Fixed effects are variables that are constant across individuals; these variables, like age, sex, or ethnicity, typically do not change over time or change over time at a constant rate. As such, they have fixed effects on a dependent variable \\(Y\\). Let’s have a closer look at dealing with fixed-effects in the context of panel data. Video: Fixed-effect models [Lecture slides] [Watch on MS stream] Let’s try to to apply a fixed-effect model in R. For this we will use a data set containing some panel data. The data set contains data for some undefined variable \\(Y\\) for different countries and years.

For each country we have several years of data: three independent variables names \\(x_{1}\\), \\(x_{2}\\), and \\(x_{3}\\) and a dependent variable \\(y\\). As this is a panel dataset we have to declare it as such using the plm.data() function from the plm package. The plm package is a library dedicated to panel data analysis. # create a panel data object country_panel &lt;- pdata.frame(country_data, index=c(&#39;country&#39;,&#39;year&#39;)) # inspect country_panel ## country year y x1 x2 x3 ## A-1990 A 1990 1342787840 0.2779037 -1.1079559 0.28255358 ## A-1991 A 1991 -1899660544 0.3206847 -0.9487200 0.49253848 ## A-1992 A 1992 -11234363 0.3634657 -0.7894840 0.70252335 ## A-1993 A 1993 2645775360 0.2461440 -0.8855330 -0.09439092 ## A-1994 A 1994 3008334848 0.4246230 -0.7297683 0.94613063 ## [ reached &#39;max&#39; / getOption(&quot;max.print&quot;) -- omitted 65 rows ] Although the data looks the same, you can see that the row index has been updated to reflect the country and year variables. Let’s inspect the data using a boxplot as well as a conditioning plot. A coplot is a method for visualising interactions in your data set: it shows you how some variables are conditional on some other set of variables. So, for our panel data set, we can look at the variation of \\(Y\\) over time by country. The bars at top indicate the countries position from left to right starting on the bottom row. # create a quick box plot scatterplot(y ~ year, data=country_panel) ## [1] &quot;11&quot; &quot;54&quot; &quot;45&quot; &quot;55&quot; &quot;46&quot; &quot;36&quot; &quot;59&quot; # create a quick conditioning plot coplot(y ~ year|country, data=country_panel, type=&#39;b&#39;) 1.3.4 Random-effect models Random effects are the opposite of fixed effects. Contrary to fixed effects, random effects are random and difficult to predict. As such, the effect they will have on a dependent variable \\(Y\\) is not constant. Think of the cost of renting a one bedroom appartement: rental prices vary greatly depending on location. Let’s have a closer look at dealing with random-effects in the context of panel data.
