More recently, researchers have started to build on so-called location-aware technologies, exploring innovative methods to more accurately capture, visualise, and analyse individual spatiotemporal travel patterns: information that can be used to formulate strategies to accommodate the increasing demand for transport vis-à-vis growing environmental and societal concerns. This week we will be looking at capturing mobility data with GPS, specifically we will look at how to obtain, clean, and interpret a GPS data set. We will further use two Machine Learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machines and tree-based methods, to classify labeled GPS data into stay and move points. This week is structured around three short videos as well as a tutorial in R with a ‘hands-on’ application of GPS data classification. Let’s get to it!

In its simplest form, human mobility refers to the movement of individuals from location A to location B. This can be a relocation from one city to another city, as well as a trip from home to work. Transport systems provide the physical nodes and linkages that facilitate this mobility. However, transport systems and road networks in many cities around the world are under pressure as a result of unparalleled growth in private vehicle ownership and increasingly complex and fragmented travel patterns. Particularly in urban areas, this is problematic because it leads to problems such as congestion, accidents, road decay, and reduced accessibility. As such, governments and researchers throughout the world have started to recognise the need to curtail demand for private road transport, and agree that: “Technological breakthroughs [alone] are not going to provide the silver bullet for the mitigation of climate change and energy security threats caused by the transport sector” (Stradling and Anable, 2008: 195) The realisation that increasing road infrastructure and improvements in car technology are not sufficient to address the transport problems around the world has led to the idea that transport planning should shift from supply-side to demand-side passenger transport planning. For this, accurate dat are required on individual spatio-temporal behaviour. Travel data collection methods can roughly be classified into two, not mutually exclusive, methods. The first method uses self-reported data, such as data collected through telephone-assisted interviews, computer-assisted interviews, and pen-and-paper interviews. The second method relies on passively collected data, such as data collected through call-detail records and GPS data. Technological developments in the field of location-aware technologies, GPS in particular, have greatly enhanced opportunities to collect accurate data on human spatiotemporal behaviour. GPS data need to be collected and analysed systematically to be intelligible for transport researchers and policy makers. Moreover, the challenges inherent to mobile data collection techniques include not only harnessing the tools to obtain geo-referenced data, but also the development of new skills sets for cleaning, analysing, and interpreting these data. Video: GPS data [Lecture slides] [Watch on MS stream] 7.3 GPS data classification Where GPS technology can precisely register the spatiotemporal elements of activity-travel behaviour, travel characteristics need to be imputed from the data. As such, throughout the last decade or so, a plethora of methods has been developed for identifying trips, activities, and travel modes from raw GPS trajectories. These methods range from deterministic (rule-based) methods to advanced machine learning algorithms. Here, we will focus on using two types of machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machines and tree-based methods) to classify labelled GPS points into stay and move points. Video: GPS data classification [Lecture slides] [Watch on MS stream] The segmentation of GPS data into activity and travel episodes is often the first step in a more elaborate process of identifying activity types and transport modes. A major issue with GPS data imputation, however, is the necessity of a ground truth to test whether the imputation algorithm correctly categorises GPS points into activity (stay) points and trips (move) points. We will be using a set of 100 artificially created GPS tracks that contain a sequence of stays and moves in Cape Town, South Africa. For the data that we will use, the artificial GPS ‘records’ a measurement every 60 seconds. To further simulate noise in the data, a random sample comprising of 50 per cent of the data points was taken. Besides these raw GPS data, we also have access to a basic road network lay out of the Mother City. File download File Type Link Cape Town GPS and road data shp Download We will start by downloading the files, importing both into R, and having a look at what we will be working with. Be careful not to plot the road network file. Because the road network contains around 120,000 individual road segments it will take a long time to draw. Rather have a look at the data in QGIS, which is much more capable of on the fly displaying a large number of features. # load libraries library(tidyverse) library(sf) library(tmap) # read gps data gps &lt;- read_sf(&#39;raw/w07/gps_cape_town.shp&#39;) # read road data road &lt;- read_sf(&#39;raw/w07/roads_cape_town.shp&#39;) # inspect gps ## Simple feature collection with 54218 features and 14 fields ## geometry type: POINT ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 18.34291 ymin: -34.20729 xmax: 19.06105 ymax: -33.64011 ## CRS: 4148 ## # A tibble: 54,218 x 15 ## stop type duration point_id_n point_x point_y st_dev xshift yshift ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 MEDI… 30 1 -13316. -3.76e6 68 56.9 -86.7 ## 2 1 MEDI… 30 2 -13316. -3.76e6 68 65.2 -69.6 ## 3 1 MEDI… 30 5 -13316. -3.76e6 68 -13.4 106. ## 4 1 MEDI… 30 9 -13316. -3.76e6 68 129. -22.5 ## 5 1 MEDI… 30 10 -13316. -3.76e6 68 131. -109. ## 6 1 MEDI… 30 12 -13316. -3.76e6 68 8.15 -14.2 ## 7 1 MEDI… 30 14 -13316. -3.76e6 68 -1.16 -98.2 ## 8 1 MEDI… 30 16 -13316. -3.76e6 68 -37.8 5.67 ## 9 1 MEDI… 30 18 -13316. -3.76e6 68 46.3 68.6 ## 10 1 MEDI… 30 22 -13316. -3.76e6 68 -67.2 16.0 ## # … with 54,208 more rows, and 6 more variables: timestamp &lt;chr&gt;, ## # mode &lt;chr&gt;, track_id &lt;chr&gt;, move &lt;chr&gt;, activity &lt;chr&gt;, ## # geometry &lt;POINT [°]&gt; # inspect road ## Simple feature collection with 125024 features and 1 field ## geometry type: LINESTRING ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: 18.34051 ymin: -34.3001 xmax: 19.12007 ymax: -33.62755 ## CRS: 4148 ## # A tibble: 125,024 x 2 ## id geometry ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;LINESTRING [°]&gt; ## 1 1 (18.93353 -34.16301, 18.93345 -34.1631, 18.93335 -34.16318, 18.93… ## 2 2 (18.45615 -34.27366, 18.4545 -34.27321, 18.45298 -34.2728, 18.452… ## 3 3 (18.45615 -34.27366, 18.45674 -34.27201, 18.45683 -34.27181, 18.4… ## 4 4 (18.85612 -34.25045, 18.85621 -34.2506, 18.85633 -34.25087, 18.85… ## 5 5 (19.12007 -34.25944, 19.11977 -34.25952, 19.11936 -34.25961, 19.1… ## 6 6 (18.50105 -33.98948, 18.50102 -33.98942, 18.50105 -33.98935, 18.5… ## 7 7 (18.65381 -34.00991, 18.65355 -34.00979, 18.65251 -34.00931, 18.6… ## 8 8 (18.63738 -34.07209, 18.63846 -34.07193, 18.63924 -34.07183, 18.6… ## 9 9 (18.44389 -34.03779, 18.44389 -34.03798, 18.44388 -34.03826, 18.4… ## 10 10 (18.64958 -34.04498, 18.64729 -34.04547, 18.64228 -34.04652, 18.6… ## # … with 125,014 more rows # inspect names(gps) ## [1] &quot;stop&quot; &quot;type&quot; &quot;duration&quot; &quot;point_id_n&quot; &quot;point_x&quot; ## [6] &quot;point_y&quot; &quot;st_dev&quot; &quot;xshift&quot; &quot;yshift&quot; &quot;timestamp&quot; ## [11] &quot;mode&quot; &quot;track_id&quot; &quot;move&quot; &quot;activity&quot; &quot;geometry&quot; The road network file is relatively simple and only contains the road network segments - no additional information (e.g. maximum speed, road type, etc.) is available. The GPS data themselves contain several fields: Column heading Description stop Stop number within GPS track type Type of stop (i.e. short, medium, long) duration Duration of stop in seconds point_id_n Unique point identifier within GPS track timestamp Time the point was recorded mode Travel mode track_id Unique ID for GPS track move Whether point is a move or a stay activity Whether point is move (inlcuding mode) or stay The move variable is the variable we will try to predict. Before we split our data into a train and test set, however, we will need to derive some features that will serve as predictors: speed, point density, and distance to nearest road segment. 7.4 Take home message 7.5 Attributions This week’s content and practical uses content and inspiration from: Van Dijk, J. 2017.
